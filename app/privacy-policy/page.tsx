            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>
              Our mission at usaloanstoday.com (&quot;USA Loans Today&quot;) is to connect you with our marketplace of third party lenders, financial service providers, debt relief providers, aggregators, direct mail marketers, and email marketers (&quot;Service Providers&quot;).
            </p>
            <p>
              To assist us in carrying out our mission, we collect and process certain information you provide us. We work hard to be good stewards of your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect on the USA Loans Today website located at <a href="https://www.usaloanstoday.com">www.usaloanstoday.com</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW?</h2>
            <h3>Anonymous and Aggregated Web Traffic Information.</h3>
            <p>
              General traffic, site usage, browser information, length-of-stay information, and location data is collected and stored in log files. This type of information is collected and shared on an anonymous, aggregated basis meaning that we do not connect this information to your name or other personal information.
            </p>

            <h3>Personal Information (non-financial).</h3>
            <p>
              We collect all or some of the following personal information: first and last name, phone number, email address, cell phone number, date of birth, age, military affiliation, educational background, mailing address, employer, work phone number, driver&apos;s license, social security number, and zip code in the following contexts:
              <ul>
                <li>Requests for Service: To start the process of getting connected with a Service Provider, we collect the above personal information on the Loan Request form on our home page.</li>
                <li>Other Requests: We collect information volunteered by users, including from requests via the Contact Us Form on our website. We also may collect email addresses of those who communicate with us via email.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Financial Information.</h3>
            <p>
              When you request service through our Loan Request form, we also collect your bank name, bank account type, bank account number, bank routing number, months at your bank, pay dates, loan request amount, loan purpose, monthly income, pay period, primary source of income, the total amount of your debt and the type of debt (i.e. credit card debt, personal loan debt), information about your estimated credit score, income source and amount, employment information, and information about asset ownership.
            </p>

            <h3>Categories of Sources.</h3>
            <p>
              We collect information from the following categories of sources:
              <ul>
                <li>Directly from you. For example, when you complete online forms or use our website to utilize our services.</li>
                <li>Third Parties. For example, when we receive data from an affiliate, aggregator, publisher, marketer, lead generator, referring website or advertising campaign.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              We may combine personal information we collect from you with other information about you that we receive from third party sources. Service Providers that purchase your information may also supplement your personal information with other information about you that they obtained from other sources.
            </p>

            <h2>WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h2>
            <p>
              We use anonymous and aggregated information to operate, develop and improve our services.
            </p>
            <p>
              We process your personal information for the legitimate interest of connecting you with a Service Provider. We may use your financial information for the purpose of connecting you with a Service Provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              By submitting your contact information to us, you are expressly consenting to be contacted by us or by one or more Service Providers by telephone, email or postal mail. Your information may be going to an aggregator or marketer and not a lender, financial service provider, or debt relief provider. Your information can be sold multiple times leading to multiple offers from lenders, financial service providers, debt relief providers, aggregators, and other marketers.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, we may share some or all of your information with third party marketers and list managers with whom we have a business relationship, and these third party marketers and list managers may use your personal information to communicate with you about other marketing or business offers via telephone, email, direct mail, text message (std. text message rates may apply), or other channels.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may also use or disclose your information where we conclude that we are required by law or have a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of USA Loans Today, its users or the public.
            </p>
            <p>
              Processing your information for the purposes described is necessary for us to do what we do and it&apos;s in both of our interests. When we use your information based on our legitimate interests, we conduct a balancing test based on the legitimate interest, necessity of processing your information, and how such processing impacts you.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have any questions or concerns with us processing your information for this legitimate interest, please contact us.
            </p>
            <p>
              We&apos;ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that extends beyond what you may reasonably expect from a company offering referrals to a marketplace of lenders, financial service providers, or debt relief providers and that has a more significant privacy impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              USA Loans Today works with trusted vendors in the following categories to help fulfill our mission and process your information for the purposes described: call center services, delivering email, and storing data. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are contractually prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell businesses or assets. In such transactions, confidential customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of a transaction involving the sale of some or all of USA Loans Today&apos;s businesses, customer and site visitor information may be one of the transferred assets and may be disclosed in connection with negotiations relating to a proposed transaction. In such case, the transferred information may become subject to a different privacy policy.
            </p>
